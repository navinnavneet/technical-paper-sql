## Introduction

SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is a query based language used by computer programmers to communicate with databases ( RDMS). SQL was developed by IBM researchers Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlin, in 1970.

- Creating, replacing, altering, and dropping objects

- Inserting, updating, and deleting table rows

- Querying data

- Controlling access to the database and its objects

- Guaranteeing database consistency and integrity

## Broad Applications Of SQL

Alongside software development and computer programming other professions can also be benefited from SQL, such as:

- Research

- Data Science

- Business Analytics

- Database Administration

- Accontants

- Researchers

- Statisticians

- Business Strategists
